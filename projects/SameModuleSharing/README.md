# Same Module Sharing

Used to look at what the heck Xcode does under the covers to let you link between Swift and Obj-C code.
Made in frustration when basic attempts to turn a Foo.swiftmodule + Foo.h into something Obj-C can use didn't pan out.
I will gain the understanding needed to dash off quick experiments at the CLI with Swift!
